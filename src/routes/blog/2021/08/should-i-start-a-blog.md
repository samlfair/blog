Okay, let's go.

I've got two motivations to start writing.

---

**First**, there's the technology. I like web development, and I found a technology that I really like. It's called Svelte, and it allows you to create really robust websites really easily. For this project, I've combined Svelte with Markdown. You know when you put asterisks around words to make them italic in whatsapp? That's markdown.

The results means that I can write something like this:

```
<script>
  let product = 5 * 5
</script>

The **product** of five times five is {product}.
```

And it will appear on the page like this:

<script>
  let product = 5 * 5
</script>

The **product** of five times five is {product}.

<style>
pre {
  background: #eee;
  border-radius: 10px;
  padding: 10px;
}

hr {
  width: 5%;
  margin: 3vw auto 2.6vw;
}
</style>

In fact, you can look at the code for this page on GitHub. You'll be surprised by how simple it looks.

**Second**, there's ~ the world ~

I feel like I should say something about things.
