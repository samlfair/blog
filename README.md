# Sam's Blog

This is my experimental personal weblog:

[littlefair.ca](https://littlefair.ca)

The project is built in Nuxt.js, with Prismic as a CMS.

Most of the styles are (messily) written in the default layout file (which might be a contravention of the principles of component-based development).

The site is an experiment in micro-blogging and component-based development.
